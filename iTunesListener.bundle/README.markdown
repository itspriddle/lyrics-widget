iTunesListener
==============
This is based on [Harmonic](http://github.com/supapuerco/harmonic/tree/master/Dashboard%20Plugin/)

It allows us to define `itunes_notification_recieved` to be called
when an event occurs in iTunes (play, pause, change track).

I've stripped everything from the Harmonic version but the
stuff required for `itunes_notification_recieved`.
